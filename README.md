# Clean Architecture Project

This is a TypeScript project that follows the clean architecture, an approach to code organization that aims to separate responsibilities into different layers to achieve a more modular, testable, and scalable code.

## Tools Used

The project utilizes the following tools:

1. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch type-related errors early in development and enhances code quality.

2. **Yarn**: Yarn is a package manager that allows for fast and reliable package management. It ensures consistent dependencies across different environments.

3. **Vitest**: Vitest is a lightweight, framework-agnostic test runner for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. It simplifies the process of writing and running tests for your codebase.

4. **Husky**: Husky is a tool that enables you to set up Git hooks to automate tasks such as linting and testing before commits or pushes. It helps maintain code quality and consistency.

5. **ESLint**: ESLint is a highly configurable and widely used linter tool for JavaScript and TypeScript. It helps enforce coding standards and identify potential issues in your codebase.

6. **Clean Architecture Principles**: This project adheres to the principles of clean architecture, including separation of concerns, dependency inversion, and the use of interfaces and abstractions to promote modularity and maintainability.

## Configuration and Usage

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
`git clone <repository-url>`

2. **Install Dependencies**: Use Yarn to install project dependencies:
`yarn install`

All dependencies, will be installed automatically.

### Style and Quality Checking

The project is already configured to use Eslint for style and code quality checking.

- To check the TypeScrypt code with Eslint, run the following command:
` yarn lint`
